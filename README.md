# Crowd-Management-System-With-Voice-Assistant-Alert

This project demonstrates a *Crowd Management System* powered by *OpenCV* and *deep learning-based object detection* to monitor and manage crowd density in real time. It uses video feeds (live or recorded) to detect people and analyze crowd levels, helping ensure safety and avoid overcrowding.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time crowd detection
- Person detection using deep learning models (YOLO / MobileNet-SSD / Haar Cascade)
- Area density estimation
- Alerts on crowd threshold breaches
- Works on video files or webcam streams

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Pre-trained Object Detection models (YOLOv3 / MobileNet-SSD)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development & visualization)
